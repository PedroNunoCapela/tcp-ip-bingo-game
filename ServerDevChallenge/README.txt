ServerDev Challenge Project


Initial considerations:

    -> project was developed using Ubunto, VERSION="20.04.3 LTS
    -> project folder contains two subfolders, corresponding to both Coordinator's and Client's application
    -> each application folder contains respective header and source files, required for project execution


Execution instructions:

    1) open a new terminal in 'CoordinatorApp' folder
    2) using the 'ls' command, it is possible to list all files.
    3) type command './a.out' in order to run executable file and execute CoordinatorApp

    repeat the instructions above for 'ClientApp', in order to execute Client's application.



thank you :)
